# Luminary

LUMINARY is an 18+ story dealing with duty and destiny, gods and mortals, love and hate. You will follow your character through the darkness of night, intrigue of court, and maybe... just maybe, the dawn of a new era.
- Choose your pronouns, customize your appearance, and decide your personality. Are you kind or cruel? Stoic or sarcastic? Let your dialogue and decisions make your character.
- Pick what your criminal background was and how successful you were before the Emperor found you. Did you reap the profits of a drug circle? Were you the most merciless blade the Empire has ever seen?
- Romance one of six romantic options, characters who all have minds and motivations of their own. See how their development overlaps with and changes your own.
- Discover your bloodline and dictate your family dynamics. Your father is the Emperor, and your siblings are his royal spawn. But who are they behind closed doors? Oh... And who was your mother?
- Play as a character integral to the world and its history. You want to be a god? Worship often comes with blood.
- Develop your relationship with your very own star and see how the shadows react to your light.

Luminary is an ongoing game that is being created using Twine, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
